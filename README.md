## 💡 What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** is an AI approach where:

3. The AI generates an accurate response using that information

**Benefits:**
- More accurate responses (uses your actual data)
- No hallucinations or made-up information
- Always up-to-date (update knowledge base anytime)
